we need to continue working, implement all missing features in sdk and then conversely implement them into the front/backend, fix all type errors, provide proper typiung, all sheband. continue working on it. when no linter errors and typescript errors exist, we start running the test suite. If test suite is missing testing of any functionality we need to change test suite to inclkude the new tests. WE fix what the tests find, and continue testing, until everything works flawlessly. Start working on the first part of the request now.
