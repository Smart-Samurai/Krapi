we need to continue working, implement all missing features in sdk and then conversely implement them into the front/backend, fix all type errors, provide proper typiung, all sheband. continue working on it. when no linter errors and typescript errors exist, we start running the test suite. If test suite is missing testing of any functionality we need to change test suite to inclkude the new tests. WE fix what the tests find, and continue testing, until everything works flawlessly. Start working on the first part of the request now.

run the tests and start testing, and whenever an error happens, fix it, then rerun the test to confrim the fix, and repeat this process until the app is 100% functional and 100% of it's code and functions have been tested. The process is simple -> Tun the test apackage using the package.json in the root directory. Wait for the test to crash because of some error. Check what the error was. Investigate it. Fix it. Rerun the test. Repeat this process until 100% functionality is achieved. DO NOT GET STUCK IN A LOGIC LOOP.

Using the readme.md instructions, run the compehensive test suite using the root projects package.json. The test suite itself already builds and starts the services itself, so dont do that separately. The workflow is as follows -> 1. Run the test. 2. See where ti fails 3. Fix the failure point by either creating the msising functionality in the SDK, fixing the import in the backend, fixing the api in the frontend, and then rerun the test. 4. If at any point any of the functionalities in either frontend or backend are not using SDK but are communicating without it, they need to be refactored to use the SDK. Any unused old code must immediately be deleted. No mockups, no commenting out, empty functions or fake functions are allowed. This is a process to create a 100% production ready code. The tests need to actually test real functionality too and always adhere to following the principle of askin the frontend API for all interactions, and all code neds to use SDK. Now begin.

Now run a logic test -> Ask yourself "For a CMS app like this, are all the necessary CRUD operations possible and working?" And check if they are, and if not, impolement them. Than ask yourself another question. "Does all the functionality in the app correctly use SDK for everything, or are some functionalities build around it?" And look for any instances of methods built not using SDK, and fix them to use SDK. Then ask yourself the third question. "Is this app secure, and are at any point login details, api keys, or data exposed in an unsafe way in any transaction?" And then look through the code, making sure it is secure. Finally, ask yourself the final and fourth question. "Is this app optimized? Does the current code implementation work in a an optimized way, without unnecessary overhead, and old methods that have better substitutes nowadays?" And then go through the app to find any code that could be optimized further for better speed. During all of that, you are allowed to modify the test suite to fit any changes you have made to the app, to make sure that the test suite is aligned with the currenty implementations.

1. For this job, never start services manually, only ever use the testing suthe startup of the services covered. The correct way to run the test suite is to run "test:comprehensive" in the root directory which does the following = "cd KRAPI-COMPREHENSIVE-TEST-SUITE && npm run test:comprehensive", and that is what the test suite is doing. if there are any erros in how the test suite is configured - fix them. Always start the test suite using this corect command. If the command does not work - fix it.
2. For this job, make sure that the test suite runs actual full comprehensive tests on the app, without mocking any tests, providing false data, omitting tests, faking test results, making tests that do not work or don't actually check anything. The test suite should run and provide very clear and concise logs about all the tests being ran, and provbiding full and verbose ouput about any errors encountered to make it easier to debug. The test suite shjould not run duplicate tests, or duplicate checks, etc. The console logging should be concise and use as little tokens as possible while maintaining full coherency and giving all necessary infomration to debug the app. The test runner should -> Create a new docker container for the postgres to use during testing, fresh, build and start all the services (backend, frontend), and start running tests on all the operations, making real changed to the postgres database. Every time the test runner starts, it needs to make sure that there are no previous services running, and every time it stops, it needs to shut down the services, alongside deleting the docker container for the postgres that was createdw with its network.
3. For this job, run the test suite and fix any errors that are found during the test suite run. Remmeber the core principles of the app structure and the flow of data in the app, which are as follows:

- Frontend and Backend use the central SDK as a source of truth for all functions and methods to operate.
- All requests are always made to the frontend first, frontend next.js api routes are always the first point of contact and receiver of any request.
- All requests are funneled from the frontend to the backend where the operations take place and a response is then returned from the backend to the frontend which in turn responds to the initial requester.
- We never have custom code omitting the SDK for the frontent and backend to communicate with each other, as this is considered "rogue code" that is not adhering to the centralized SDK implementation.

4. Fix every issue in the app not adhering ot the rules,. fix every issue in the testing suite that needs to be fixed, and work until the test suite covers 100% of the actual app functionality, the tests are real and robust, and they pass with 100% completion rate for every single operation, marking the app as production ready and finished. Remember that mocking functionality, faking functionality, or commenting out functionality to make tests pass is wrogn and unacceptable. Everything needs to be an actual working functionality.

5. Important note - Never run npm or pnpm dev manually for either service. Never Ever.
